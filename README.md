Problem Statement: Book Review System
-> Readers often struggle to decide which books to read due to the overwhelming number of options available.
-> Existing review sources may lack authenticity, with fake or biased reviews reducing trust.
-> There is no unified, community-driven platform that encourages active participation and rewards trustworthy contributions.

Solution: Book Review System
-> Develop an online book review platform where users can upload reviews, rate books, and read feedback from others before making a choice.
-> Implement a verified badge system to recognize and reward active members who consistently provide reliable, high-quality reviews.
-> Provide features such as search, categorization, and personalized recommendations to make the reading experience more engaging and efficient.
-> Encourage community interaction through likes, comments, and sharing, fostering a trustworthy reading ecosystem.
